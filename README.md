This is a graduation work for the 2022 Data Librarian Certificate Course from the Technical University Cologne. The result of the graduation work is a script, which is called OCA.py. The script was published in August 2022. This is the corresponding jupyter-notebook with additional insights.

## Requirements

The following python-libraries are required.

* requests
* BeautifulSoup
* pandas
* os
* numpy
* pprint
* matplotlib
* pillow
* shutil
* seaborn

This software also uses Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Usage
In this graduation_work branch, the script is specifically tailored towards the METS-file-location from the Staats- und Universit√§tsbibliothek Hamburg. You only need to provide the record identifier in order to use it. This also means, that you can currently just test it on objects from this specific library. For other METS-files a refactoring is necessary.
